LuaLDAP was originally created by [Kepler Project](http://www.keplerproject.org/).
A CVS-to-Git conversion was done by [LuaForge](http://luaforge.net/) from [their project](http://luaforge.net/projects/lualdap/) to [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/luaforge/lualdap).
From there various members of the community took over and curated fixes and improvements in a new [repository under the LuaLDAP GitHub organisation](https://github.com/lualdap/lualdap).
